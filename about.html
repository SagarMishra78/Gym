      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Gym and Fitness was founded in 2002 as a family owned and operated business. The Gym and Fitness founders
        didn’t want it to be just another gym equipment retailer - they wanted to be the best in the industry and set
        their minds to doing so! Since its birth, Gym and Fitness has grown into one of Australia’s largest online
        fitness equipment retailers having helped over 50,000 customers live longer, happier and healthier lives.</p>
